# drawbot2
arduino-based drawing robot.
For custom PCB and chassis, shown at http://nichansendesign.com/action.html#automating
Scans ~180Â° area (with IR) for distance and (with some error correction) chooses most open direction to drive (while drawing). 
Stops based on proximity and then repeats. 
Tight spots can trigger backing up.
Very open spots can trigger celebratory "donuts."
